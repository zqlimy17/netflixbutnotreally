## About the App

**SMDb** is a MERN API that allows users to search for movies and save them as favourites. SMDb heavily relies on *The Movie Database (__TMDb__)* for information. 

## MVC
SMDb backend revolves around the `User.js` model and the `movies.js` controller while the frontend View is built on React. 

Whenever a User "likes" a movie, the movie ID will be stored in the User model. This model will be the root source of getting information from TMDb's API to populate content on the Views. 

The `movies.js` controller controls liking or un-liking a movie. 

The app can work without a current User.
